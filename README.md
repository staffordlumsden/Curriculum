## Current Responsibilities
### Coordinate curriculum management processes and proposals
In my role at the Law School, I manage curriculum reviews, assessment redesign, and approval processes, including chairing the Unit Outline Approval Committee. This requires aligning unit and program designs with AQF expectations, CALD Threshold Learning Outcomes, Graduate Qualities, and governance requirements.

### Support evidence-based education projects
I have led multiple initiatives grounded in research, including AI-enabled feedback pilots, competency-based assessment design, and research training reforms. These projects are evaluated against evidence of student learning and engagement, and I have secured funding through internal and national education grants.

### Conduct policy research, analysis and reporting
I regularly prepare submissions for the Academic Board, Law Extension Committee, and LPAB governance review, drawing on TEQSA HESF, HESA compliance, and professional standards. These contributions demonstrate my ability to interpret complex policy and provide actionable advice.

### Prepare briefs, submissions, and reports
My governance and project work require producing clear, concise, and well-structured briefs and reports for senior leadership. Examples include submissions on AI in education, assessment policy, and student support initiatives, all of which informed faculty and university-level decision-making.

### Build effective working relationships across the University
I collaborate with colleagues in the DVC Education portfolio, Library, and ADEs to deliver cross-faculty initiatives such as Just-in-Time research skills training and the LMS uplift project. I also liaise externally with UNSW and UNE as an expert consultant on AI in education, demonstrating my capacity to build productive networks.

### Undertake ad-hoc curriculum projects
My portfolio includes diverse initiatives, from the Ngura competency-based assessment project to the development of AI literacy frameworks for undergraduate and postgraduate law. This variety shows my adaptability and capacity to deliver ad-hoc projects aligned with strategic priorities.

## Selection Criteria Statement
| **Selection Criterion** | **Evidence of Achievement** |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **1. Tertiary qualifications in a relevant field and/or equivalent project management or research experience** | I hold a PhD in Applied Linguistics from Macquarie University, with a research focus on multimodal learning and curriculum design. This has equipped me with advanced skills in policy analysis, research design, and evidence-based curriculum development. My doctoral work was complemented by roles in educational design where I have applied project management methodologies to curriculum review, policy implementation, and assessment reform across multiple universities. |
| **2. Demonstrated experience managing complex processes within large or multifaceted organisations** | In my current role as Educational Designer at Sydney Law School, I manage curriculum approval processes for over 300 units of study, coordinating between academics, professional staff, and governance bodies. As Chair of the Unit Outline Approval Committee, I oversee alignment with AQF, CALD Threshold Learning Outcomes, Graduate Qualities, and faculty standards. These processes involve managing competing stakeholder interests, strict governance timelines, and regulatory compliance. I have also contributed to whole-of-faculty projects such as the Canvas LMS Template Uplift, requiring coordination across academic and professional portfolios. |
| **3. Experience working in the higher education or tertiary sector (desirable)** | I have over a decade of experience across leading Australian universities, including the University of Sydney, University of Wollongong, and Macquarie University. I have designed, implemented, and evaluated curriculum initiatives at both faculty and institutional levels, working closely with ADEs, the DVC Education portfolio, and Academic Board committees. My external engagements as a consultant on AI in education with UNSW and UNE further demonstrate my sectoral experience and credibility. |
| **4. Proven project management experience, including delivering initiatives to deadlines and governance requirements** | I have led multiple high-profile projects, including the Law School LMS Template Uplift, the AI in Legal Education framework, and competency-based assessment initiatives for Ngura. Each project required planning, stakeholder consultation, and delivery against tight deadlines and governance requirements. For example, the LMS Uplift was delivered in alignment with the University’s strategic timeline for teaching readiness, ensuring universal design for learning principles were embedded while minimising staff training burden. |
| **5. Strong skills in policy analysis, research and report writing** | I regularly prepare briefs, submissions, and reports for committees and governance bodies. Examples include submissions to the LPAB governance review, policy briefs on AI and assessment integrity, and compliance reports aligned with TEQSA HESF standards. My reports have directly informed Academic Board and faculty decisions, and my published research demonstrates my ability to integrate scholarship with applied policy recommendations. |
| **6. Excellent organisational and administrative skills with attention to detail** | In my role, I manage simultaneous curriculum reforms, research ethics applications, and project deliverables. I developed a systematic approach to curriculum mapping that integrates unit learning outcomes with course learning outcomes and graduate qualities, ensuring compliance while providing clarity for academics. My administrative oversight ensures all curriculum documentation is accurate, consistent, and aligned with governance requirements. |
| **7. Highly developed interpersonal, negotiation and written communication skills with the ability to work collaboratively across diverse stakeholder groups** | I work closely with senior academics, governance committees, and professional staff to deliver curriculum initiatives. For example, in leading the Just-in-Time research training initiative, I negotiated between the Library, DVC Education portfolio, and faculty units to design a shared delivery model. I have a reputation for producing clear, persuasive written communication, which has been critical in securing grant funding and in gaining support for curriculum reforms. My ability to engage across diverse groups is also evidenced by external consultancy roles, where I advise peer institutions on AI and educational design. |

## Role Alignment Analysis
### 1. Alignment with Role Purpose
The position is about supporting curriculum governance, policy, and project delivery at a whole-of-university level.

This demonstrates my extensive experience across academic, governance, and operational priorities at scale.
